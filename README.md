# RAP: A Software Framework of Developing Convolutional Neural Networks for Environmental Monitoring on Resource-constrained Devices
RAP permits the construction of the CNN designs by aggregating the existing, lightweight CNN layers which are able to fit in the limited memory (e.g., several KBs of SRAM)
on the resource-constrained devices satisfying application-specific timing constrains.
